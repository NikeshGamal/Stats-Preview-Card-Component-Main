## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- used new CSS proprties like background-color-blend-mode 

### What I learned

While coding this challenge, I have learned some new property of backgound property i.e. background-color-blend-mode. Using this property we can blend the background color and background image so it will have amazing effect on the image.

Also, in this challenge, I have followed mobile-design to desktop-design approach which was new to me.
Adding further, I have also imported the font-family that I was not sure of but now I am much cofortable with importing the fonts.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter&display=swap');
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lexend+Deca:wght@400;700&display=swap');

 background-color: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-image: url("image-header-mobile.jpg");
    background-blend-mode:multiply;

```


### Continued development

I am still not very much confortable with giving paths for any images. So, obviously will work on that part in future projects. I still lack the smooth transition between different screen sizes and that I need to work on more. Looking for better aapraoch while using CSS will be also my search as there are such properties like background-color-blend-mode that I was unaware of but was quite interesting at the end of the day.
